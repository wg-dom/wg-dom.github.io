									<h4>Scope</h4>
								</header></center>
								<p>The Deformable Object Manipulation (DOM) Working Group aims to advance the
                                    development and application of robots for manipulating non-rigid, deformable objects. Our
                                    scope encompasses various deformable materials, including textiles, cables, food items,
                                    biological tissues, and other soft or flexible materials. The WG will focus on addressing key
                                    challenges in the field, such as the perception and modeling of deformable objects, the
                                    development of adaptive control strategies, the integration of tactile and force feedback, and
                                    the creation of robust planning algorithms for complex manipulation tasks. We will explore
                                    the application of cutting-edge technologies, including generative AI, machine learning, soft
                                    robotics, and advanced sensing, to enhance the capabilities of robotic systems in handling
                                    deformable objects. The working group will serve as a platform for interdisciplinary
                                    collaboration, bringing together researchers in robotics, materials science, computer vision,
                                    and control theory to share knowledge, identify research priorities, and develop best
                                    practices. By fostering innovation in deformable object manipulation, we aim to significantly
                                    expand the capabilities of robotic systems across various domains, including manufacturing,
                                    healthcare, household robotics, and agriculture, ultimately leading to more versatile and
                                    capable robotic solutions for complex real-world tasks involving non-rigid materials.</p>

									<h4>Motivation</h4>
								</header></center>
								<p>The motivation behind the Deformable Object Manipulation Working Group stems from the
                                    increasing need for robotic systems capable of handling non-rigid, deformable materials with
                                    the same dexterity and reliability as humans. While significant progress has been made in
                                    the robotic manipulation of rigid objects, the manipulation of deformable objects remains a
                                    significant challenge due to their complex dynamics, infinite degrees of freedom, and
                                    difficulty in predicting their behavior. This gap in capability limits the application of robotics in
                                    many important domains, including textile manufacturing, food processing, medical
                                    procedures, and domestic tasks. The potential impact of advancing deformable object
                                    manipulation is immense, promising to revolutionize industries, improve surgical outcomes,
                                    and enhance the capabilities of assistive and household robots. However, achieving these
                                    goals requires overcoming substantial technical hurdles in perception, modeling, and control.
                                    This working group is motivated by the potential to accelerate progress in the field by
                                    fostering collaboration between experts from various disciplines, sharing best practices, and
                                    addressing common challenges collectively. By focusing on deformable object manipulation,
                                    we aim to push the boundaries of robotic capabilities, opening up new possibilities for
                                    automation and human-robot collaboration in tasks that have traditionally been too complex
                                    for robots to handle effectively.</p>
